            It all began in the year 2002 when I started to get into coding and software developing. Being only twelve years old, I naturally 
            cared most about games and how they are made, since I've always been a lover of gaming. This led me to a nice little application 
            called the RPG Maker 2000.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was easy, there was a GUI for the maps and you did not have to care about anything but the design of the game and the story, 
            since dialogs and battles were created pretty straight-forward. But one had the ability to create an own battle system, even complexe 
            character menus and much more, only by sticking together simple statements to bigger structures - and this is when the developer in me 
            came to life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Shortly after experimenting with such "code" and learning the basics of if/else structures and loops by myself, I wanted to create my own 
            website for smaller "scripts" I wrote in the RPG Maker 2000 for others to use. So I started to learn HTML and PHP by the age of thirteen 
            which ultimately led me to the Secondary school for information technology in Zurich, Switzerland that I started by the age of 16.
        </p>
        <p>
            Starting all by myself, years later, I am a well educated developer whose passion lies in high quality software and web development. My goal 
            is good software. Software that is fun to use and fun to maintain.

            The <a href="http://transport.opendata.ch" target="_blank" title="transport.opendata.ch">Opendata Transport API</a> by the swiss organisation "Open Data" provides simple access to swiss public transport data, such as train connections or time tables for stations.

        <p>
            Since I develop a lot of applications using Symfony2 or Silex and the handling of JSON data in Symfony2 can be done in many different ways, I wanted to create a Symfony2 bundle to handle requests, parse the returned JSON and transform the data within into objects of simple data classes for other developers to use. The project itself started soon and was finished within a few weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
            I learned a lot about bundle development in general and much about Open Source because this was my very first self developed Open Source project.

            The <a href="http://www.hellvetia.ch" title="www.hellvetia.ch">Hellvetia Metal Group</a> is a swiss association of people that dedicate their work to Heavy Metal Music. Since I love Heavy Metal myself, I decided to join this association as their "IT departement", taking care of the server infrastructure, the development of the website and its design as well as setup of a Wiki, a CI server, and an API, and of all IT related processes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Built on the shoulders of Git, Symfony2, FreeBSD and MySQL, this project is still ongoing because of the growing audience of the online radio and the partnership with other companies. The API itself will be used for an Android App to reach even more fans and friends of "Hellvetia".
        </p>
        <p>
            Because I'm in charge of the whole DEV, this project taught me a lot about system administration and deployment processes. Because this project lies on a shared host, I was forced to develop an own concept and implementation for a CI, which was a perfect chance to gain insight into many different approaches for a good CI solution.
